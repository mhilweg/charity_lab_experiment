    <h1>Welcome to the task! </h1>
    <p>In this task, you will be given a sequence of eight numbers.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to apply specific rules to compute the response for the seventh step. 
    While you are free to input values into response boxes 1 to 6 as well, you must enter a value for <strong>the seventh response box</strong>, which is mandatory. This is the only response upon which we will determine whether you solved the task correctly. 
    Please pay attention to the rules, as they determine your task performance.</p>

        <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
            <li>üîç To compute the first response, compare the first two numbers of the sequence. If they are identical, the correct response is the very same number again. If they are different, input the one of the three numbers that is not present. For example, if you compare '1' and '4', the correct response is '9'.</li>
            <li>üîç For the second response, compare the first response with the third number of the sequence. The third response is based on the comparison of the second response and the fourth number of the sequence, and so on.</li>
