     <h1>Welcome to the task! </h1>
    <p>
    In this task, you will work with sequences of eight numbers, which can be either 1, 4, or 9. 
    To facilitate your understanding, consider the sample picture below. The sequence of eight numbers is displayed with white boxes. 
    Below it, there are seven response boxes, with the first six being blue and the seventh one being green.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your goal is to apply specific rules to compute the <strong>final response for the seventh step</strong> of each sequence. 
    While you are free to input values into response boxes 1 to 6 as well, you must enter a value for the
    <strong>seventh response box</strong>, which is mandatory. This is the <strong>only response</strong> upon which we will determine 
    whether you solved the task correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Below, we teach you one method for solving this task, but it is just one of many possible ways. 
    <strong>You are free to use this method or any other</strong>, as only the correctness of your final answer determines your 
    bonus payment of <strong>{ bonus_per_correct_answer }‚Ç¨</strong> per correct response. There are <strong>hidden patterns</strong> to discover in the sequences that
    make it easier to find the correct seventh response.  
    </p>

    You will play two versions of this task. Each version
    has a <strong>maximum of { number_of_tasks } sequences</strong>. Thus, you can earn a total bonus payment of up to 8.40 EUR. Please pay close attention to the rules, as they 
    will guide you in solving the task.

        <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
            <li>üîç To compute the first response, compare the first two numbers of the sequence. If they are identical, the correct response is the very same number again. If they are different, input the one of the three numbers that is not present. For example, if you compare '1' and '4', the correct response is '9'.</li>
            <li>üîç For the second response, compare the first response with the third number of the sequence. The third response is based on the comparison of the second response and the fourth number of the sequence, and so on.</li>
